Postmortem: Webstack Outage on October 31, 2022
Issue Summary
On October 31, 2022, from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM EST, our webstack experienced an outage that significantly impacted user experience. During this period, approximately 25% of our user base reported slow load times and timeouts.

Timeline
•	2:00 PM EST: Monitoring alerts triggered for high server load and slow response times.
•	2:05 PM EST: An engineer noticed the alerts and began investigating.
•	2:15 PM EST: Investigation began on the front-end application and database servers.
•	2:30 PM EST: Initial assumption was high traffic causing the server to slow down.
•	3:00 PM EST: Investigation expanded to the load balancer and CDN.
•	3:30 PM EST: Further investigation revealed an issue with the CDN configuration.
•	4:00 PM EST: Incident was escalated to the DevOps team for resolution.
Root Cause and Resolution
The root cause of the outage was a misconfigured CDN, which was caching and serving outdated content. This led to repeated requests to the server, causing high server load and slow response times. The issue was resolved by updating the CDN configuration to correctly cache and serve updated content.
Corrective and Preventative Measures
To prevent similar issues in the future, we will implement the following measures:
•	Regular checks on the CDN configuration to ensure it is functioning correctly.
•	Monitoring the CDN to alert on cache hit/miss ratio and cache size.
•	Updating the incident response plan to include specific steps for investigating CDN-related issues.
By taking these steps, we aim to enhance our system’s reliability and ensure a better user experience moving forward.
